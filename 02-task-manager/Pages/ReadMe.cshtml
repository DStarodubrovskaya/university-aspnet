        <p>
            In this project I built a Task Manager system based on Razor Pages and MongoDB.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are two main entities: <b>Users</b> and <b>Tasks</b>, each connected to its own collection in MongoDB.
            Tasks can be assigned to existing users, and when a user is deleted, they are also automatically unassigned from all tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
            The system allows:<br />
            ✔ Adding, deleting, and assigning tasks<br />
            ✔ Filtering tasks by user and status<br />
            ✔ Updating tasks with pre-loaded data<br />
            ✔ Adding and deleting users<br />
            ✔ Displaying tasks in a table with clean Bootstrap design
        </p>

        <p>
            I used <b>Dependency Injection</b> to easily access both services (Tasks and Users) inside my Razor Pages. It made the code much simpler, because almost every page uses both services for different tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            I used <b>TempData</b> for passing success/error messages between requests. I didn't use <b>Session</b> because there wasn't really a need for storing user-specific long-term state.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also used <b>Routing with Id parameter</b> for actions like updating tasks, to dynamically pass the task Id through the URL and load correct data.
        </p>

        <p>
            For some specific parts I used ChatGPT. Mostly for:<br />
            ✔ Bootstrap CSS help<br />
            ✔ Proper date visualization without showing default values<br />
            ✔ Improvement of page reload logic after Update (in UpdateTask)<br />
            ✔ Date restrictions to prevent selecting past dates and automatically showing today's date<br />
            ✔ Generation clean code comments<br />
            (all marked in my code)
